# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
The end-target of the goal of this machine learning model is to identify and classify the images of several different hand gestures.

# Loading the Data:
This current project uses the *Hand Gesture Recognition Database* . The dataset consists of 20000 images in total each displaying a different hand gesture. There is a total of 10 hand gestures of 10 different people which are presented in the dataset. In sub total, there are 5 female and 5 male subjects.

# Creating the model:

Here we use a convolutional neural network , which takes an image as an input and assigns importance (weights and bias) to several different objects present in the image and hence they result in a clear cut difference which allows us to differentiate between the images. We use a ConvNet as it is easy to preprocess the data.

# Conclusion:

Based on the above model presented , we can conclude that the DL model successfully classifies several different hand gestures images with a good accuracy.
